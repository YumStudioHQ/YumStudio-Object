# YumStudio-Object

YumStudio Object (YSObject) is a simple object notation file format.
Developped by Wys, designed for the YumStudio meta-engine project.
Idea is to provide a simple, light notation format, where types are ignored. All APIs provided by that repository have as main goal to use only standard libraries (e.g. .NET, STL, Python's libs), without requiring your projects to grow by libraries.
